# Nutrients

Overview

The goal of this project is to build a webapp that allows users to enter their food intake and receive insight about the nutrition values of those products. It should also provide recommendations on other foods to enter their diet to improve nutrition levels.
Project aims:

•	User accounts that can store the foods you eat throughout the day

•   Provide insights into how nutritious the food you are eating is

•	Provide support for how your diet can be improved

A side script should be made where i can convert the overall data into a csv and put into a tableau book, which can be used by project managers to find insights about the users of this product.
Initially, this project will use Supabase as the database solution however will convert to a proprietary database developed by me.

•	A simple layer of abstraction should be developed to make database migration fast and clean.

The projects’ ultimate goal, is to be a learning experience for myself, some functionality may be developed/over engineered for the sake of my learning.
The Technical stack includes Python, C++ and PostgreSQL with note-worthy tools/frameworks being Flask, Supabase, and Vercel. the rest are in my config folder.

I will make the page designs on paper and write the html/js all by hand. AI will be doing the CSS because was on track to get a level 2 in GCSE art.
