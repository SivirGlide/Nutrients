# Nutrients

Overview

The goal of this project is to build a webapp that allows users to enter their food intake and receive insight about the nutrition values of those products. It should also provide recommendations on other foods to enter their diet to improve nutrition levels.
Project aims:

•	User accounts that can store the foods you eat throughout the day

•   Provide insights into how nutritious the food you are eating is

•	Provide support for how your diet can be improved

The data should be converted into a csv with the click of a button and put into a tableau book, which can be used by project managers to find insights about the users of this product.
Initially, this project will use Supabase as the database solution however will convert to a proprietary database developed by me.


•	A simple layer of abstraction should be developed to make database migration fast and clean.

The projects’ ultimate goal, is to be a learning experience for myself, some functionality may be developed/over engineered for the sake of my learning.
The Technical stack includes Python, C++ and ProstgreSQL with specific tools/frameworks being Flask, Supabase, Pandas, Vercel and Tableau public.
