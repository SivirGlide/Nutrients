# Nutrients

Overview

The goal of this project is to build a webapp that allows users to enter their food intake and receive insight about the nutrition values of those products.
Project aims:

•	User accounts that can store the foods you eat throughout the day

•   Provide insights into how nutritious the food you are eating is

A key objective is to practice and develop architectural development skills, understanding how lots of little parts of the system come together in a loosely coupled fashion.
